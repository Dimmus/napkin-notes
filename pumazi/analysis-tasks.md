# Analysis Tasks

I've recently added an *Analysis* label to the CTE trello board. The follow is an explaination of why I did that...

## About the “Analysis” classification

Very often the work involved in discussing a question about slated work goes untracked. I’ve pulled a lean agile concept from my past to hopefully address this issue. The idea here is to record the design work as well as the tangible work that goes into completing a story. **Analysis tasks** are a classification of actual work that is similar to implementable tasks. Analysis task are used to decompose stories into other analysis (further questions) and implementable tasks (actionable work).

## Its role in decomposition

One way to decompose a story is to ask questions about the topic and come to a consenses of how to implement without actually implementing. Essentially, planning an implementation as much as possible or producing more questions that need answered (or analyzed).

## An example

For example, [Cook HTML during publication and/or invocation](https://trello.com/c/68A09XZL/18-cook-html-during-publication-and-or-invocation)

The first two children cards ([card](https://trello.com/c/sxoS2z0f/33-what-happens-on-failure-to-cook-content) & [card](https://trello.com/c/tkeEFoEN/34-how-will-cnx-publishing-know-to-cook-content-published-by-zope)) of this Macro Card are Analysis tasks that have been setup to further decompose the broad concept of work into implementable tasks. (At the time of writing this...) So far we've discussed one of them and have come to a conclusion that gets us closer to creating implementable tasks.

The work that went into these tasks actually equates to a lot of time when you factor writing/talking about the problem, capturing various solutions/answers and discussing them with the entire team. For example, if it takes one person 5 minutes (usually much longer) to talk about the question with 4 team members, that adds up to 25mins of time worked. Then you would add in the times it takes to muse about possible answers/solutions and how long it takes to come to a decision. That adds up to a lot of time.

## In conclusion

The time it takes to design isn't something we currently track, but it should be because it adds up to a lot of time. This writeup tries to conclude that analysis and design is actual work that should be tracked just as equally as the implementation (actionable work).

Ideally, analysis tasks are used to acquire information that can be used to decompose stories in the future sprint. But first things first...
