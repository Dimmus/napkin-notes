## Product Description

A short lived project to address CPT1.01.01 as a service run in the OpenStax Cloud and used by Content Managers.

The CNX Press product has two components:

1. Command-line interface (CLI) -- Used by Content Managers to acquire and submit content for validation, preview and publication.
2. HTTP API -- Interacted with via the CLI to provide content validation, preview and publication.

The CLI acts as a wrapper around a fully functional an HTTP API. The HTTP API will run as a separate service from existing services because it will change architectural roles throughout its lifetime (see also Suggested Action Timeline). The CLI tool will therefore require only minimal dependencies, because the brunt of the work will be done in the external service.

The HTTP API service will be the component of this project that will change over time. It's anticipated CLI workflow a Content Manger uses will largely remain the same. Over time the HTTP API will add features (see Suggested Action Timeline for more details).

## Product Usage Mockup

The Content Manager (CM) will utilize this project via the terminal or command-line. Tenatively for the purpose of this document we'll call the executable CLI component: `berg`.

Here are a number of different ways to potentially use the CLI:

(Note, `<stderr>` here just denotes that the output is over stderr, not that is is actually printed.)

Download:

```sh
$ berg download col11406/latest
Downloading col11406 version 1.9
... cached at ./.download-cache/col11406_1.9_complete.zip
./.download-cache/col11406_1.9_complete.zip
$ echo $?
0
$ berg download -q col11406/1.9
./.download-cache/col11406_1.9_complete.zip
$ echo $?
0
```

Acquisition and expansion:

```sh
$ berg get col11405/latest
Downloading col11405 version 1.2
... cached at ./.download-cache/col11405_1.2_complete.zip
Expanding to ./col11405
./col11405
$ echo $?
0
$ berg get -q col11405/1.2
./col11405
$ echo $?
0
$ berg get col11405/1.2
Downloading col11405 version 1.2
... using cached copy at ./.download-cache/col11405_1.2_complete.zip
Expanding to ./col11405
<stderr>./col11405 already exists, existing without expansion of the download
$ echo $?
1
```

The expansion part of this will delete the `index.cnxml` file and replace it with the `index_auto_generated.cnxml` file.

Validation:

```sh
$ cd ./col11405
$ berg validate .
Validating col11405 ...
Ok. :)
$ echo $?
0
$ echo "<content>foo bar</content>" >> ./m37151/index.cnxml
$ berg validate .
Validating col11405 ...
<stderr>Some xml validation message for about the extra xml
Failed. :(
$ echo $?
1
```

Login:

```sh
$ berg login
Username: *******
Password: xxxxxxx
Authenticating ...
<stderr>Failed to authenticate user *******.
$ echo $?
1
$ berg login
Username: *******
Password: *******
Authenticating ...
May the schwartz be with you. :)
$ echo $?
0
```

This will enable you to do authenticated actions, such as preview and publish.

List endpoints:

```sh
$ berg endpoints add --name local http://localhost:6543
$ echo $?
0
$ berg endpoints
ID               URL

$ echo $?
0
$ berg endpoints --mark-default local
$ echo $?
0
$ berg endpoints | grep 'default'
local (default)  http://localhost:6543
$ echo $?
0
```

Publication:

```sh
$ cd ./col11405
$ berg publish .
Validating col11405 ...
Pushing source to <configured uri (e.g. https://press.cnx.org)> for publication
... Validating col11405

## Software Deliverables

Two new applications will be created.

1. CM CLI utility (`berg`) -- is the direct interface for the CMs to the HTTP API in the Press service.
1. Press service (HTTP API) (`press`) -- is an HTTP API we will use to mimic Zope style publications. It will also act as the hub for validating content and potentially prototyping a PDF preview service.

Three new library packages will be used/created to fulfill the implementation of the above applications:

1. `cnxml` -- for validating collxml and cnxml content. This package will likely contain the RNG files for validating the content and not much more than that.
1. `cnx-completezip` -- for constructing, deconstructing and validating the completezip format. This package will depend on `cnxml` for validating the contents of a completezip.
1. `cnx-db` -- an database abstraction library for unifying database interactions between projects (i.e. cnx-publishing and cnx-archive). Provides a layer of abstraction between HTTP and database interactions, though the library itself will be designed based on existing database logic found in cnx-publishing and cnx-archive.

As a side-effect, we will also be improving the `cnx-publishing` and `cnx-archive` codebase by unifying the database logic in `cnx-db`. This will unify, abstract and speed up the tests for these packages. Additionally, if future usecases arise that require access to the database (yes, it could happen... can you see the future?) we will be in a good position to simply use the database layer in those cases.




## Strategy

### Human Resource Needs

We'll need a project manager (Bruce P.) to lead scrum, slate the work for a sprints and update the timeline as needed.

We'll need 2-3 developers (Michael M., Ross R. and Karen C.) to effectively coordinate changes between 2 products. At any given point in time, there are only 2-3 tasks that can be done in parallel.

We'll need someone from QA (Alan C.) to facilitate and organize the testing.

The feedback collection activies will require someone (Alan C. maybe?). This might seem like a small amount of work. If done properly it should effectively caputure the user's thoughts enough so that the developer doesn't need to interrupt the resouce with future information gathering.

Deployments will require devops and hinge on `cnx-deploy` being in use. There will be some new provisioning of boxes if the parallel instance of `cnx-publishing` is used for the A and hidden B testing/comparison.

### Suggested Action Timeline

The **Task section** within this document is an example of a linear set of tasks with **deliverable checkpoints**. One or more checkpoint areas could be included in a sprint. The idea is is to deliver features as soon as possible. While they will not be complete, they will progressively get better and start to fulfill the Content Manager's (CM) workflow as we understand it.

The command-line interface (CLI) component, tentatively named `berg`, is the foundation for interacting with an external shared service, we are tentatively calling `press`, to do publications and other activities. The Press service will provide an HTTP API for validating, publishing, previewing, etc.

The CLI will be kept purposely simple and dependency-less (if possible) to make the application installable on any platform. By providing a solution for those that donâ€™t want to or cannot install the required dependencies, we make a tool for a wider audience and utilize our existing system architecture in the process.

The Press HTTP API for submission of content in the completezip format. For the purposes of calling this service something useful, it is called CNX Press or just Press thoughout this document. It is also documented as `press` in the technical details of this document.

#### Prerequisites

The initial deliverables are building blocks that will be used throughout the project. We will create libraries for interacting with data. This will enable the the CLI and Press to share the same logic to achieve their goals.

#### Initial efforts

The initial efforts concentrate on establishing the foundations of the CLI component and have it installed on the CM's machine to solidify the practice of using the tool. Later, it will act as the main interface for achieving the CM's workflow.

By concentrating on the CLI first, we give a deliverable item that can be minimally used. This will establish a baseline ensuring that all CMs can and have installed the tool for use. This establishes the assumption that the core interface is installed and functional.

#### Interate ...

Initially, the Press HTTP API will accept completezip formatted content and validates it. Later we will take this same service add the ability to publish content to the archive similar to how Zope would have done the publication. This will crudely eliminate the need to publish via Zope. As a result, we can further work towards decommisioning Zope altogether.

#### Iterate ...

Press will provide a means for transforming the completezip payload to an internal EPUB. (This can be done in parallel with the Zope style publication. Think of it like an experiment for working out the kinks. Effectively it puts real eyes on the EPUB and html formats.) Doing this will repurpose the service as an Authoring component rather than a Publishing one. The service will start to look and act more like what `cnx-authoring` does and less like what `cnx-publishing` does. In fact, this change to transforming the content to use the internal EPUB is to allow Press to submit an EPUB as a publication payload to Publishing.

#### Iterate ...

Note, these later iteration items might not even be necessary, because by this time we may have been able to fully develop an authoring environment.

#### Iterate ...

Later still... we will completely disable the parallel Zope style publication logic. The service will now proxy information to Publishing.

#### Iterate ...

Finally, we throw Press away in favor of using Publishing directly.




## Tasks

- - -

### Collect and address feedback on usage of `press`

#### Description

Collect and record individual feedback about the usage/interactions the Content Managers are having with the `press` service through `berg`. Analyze the feedback for themes and shared painpoints.

Address any bugs by creating issues in the sprint's managment software of choice. Revise the product timetables based on the amount of revision, design changes, and issues added to the product backlog. Inform the stakeholders of the new timetable.

#### Exit Criteria

* Feedback has been recorded (captured in writing) in the form of issues (note, nothing is being done with this feedback; at this point no judgment is being made about the feedback, just that it exists; later developers will make judgments)
* Future tasks have been added to the product backlog (not the current sprint)
* Developers have judged the newly created tasks and estimated effort necessary for completion
* Stakeholders have been informed of the updated timetable

#### Benefits

* Gives the developers feedback in the form that doesn't interupt the current sprinting process
* Formally provides a information loop for all stakeholders

### Implement `berg`'s `endpoints` command

#### Description

See the Usage Mockup for CLI details. Creates, reads, updates and deletes (CRUD) endpoints for `berg` to work against. Up to this point, the endpoint has been hardcoded into `berg`. This provides a means for configuring and adjusting that configuration to work with more than one environment (i.e. dev, qa, prod).

Revise the `login` command to authenticate against a default or optionally a specific endpoint. Ensure that authentication information is mapped to specific services and that this information is not lost when switching endpoints.

Enable the use of an optional flag to set the endpoint on commands that interact with `press` services.

#### Exit Criteria

* The Usage Mockup and the actual output match or have been adjusted
* `berg endpoints --help` is helpful
* The unit tests should cover 100% of the `endpoints` command:

* The unit tests should cover changes to other commands that use endpoints:
  * authentication is mapped to endpooints
  * commands that use `press` default to use the default endpoint
  * commands understand and use a specified endpoint when given
* A tag and release has been made

#### Benefits

### Deploy `press` in production

#### Description

Deploy `press` to production.

#### Exit Criteria

* `press` has been deployed to production

### Implement cnxml to html conversion in `press`

#### Description

(TOO BIG, needs more decomposition)

Create the API endpoint for receiving a completezip payload. Validate the contents of the completezip. Convert all the contents of the completezip to an EPUB. Provide the same validate feedback as the validation endpoint.

Once the completezip is accepted and all the contents have been converted, run html validation on the content. Report the validation feedback similar to the validation endpoint.

After validation, persist the contents to the EPUB format on the filesystem.

A second endpoint should be created to enable downloading of EPUB artifacts. (This can be a static view to a filesystem directory.)

(Optionally, experiment with [pyramid_swagger](https://pyramid-swagger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a means for defining the endpoint's API definition.)
(Optionally, experiment with making this async.)

#### Exit Criteria

* The creation of logic/functions for converting the contents of the completezip to an EPUB
* The tests should cover:
  * (should not cover) publication of the content
  * persistence of the EPUB artifact to the filesystem
  * cases that show useful debug information in the response during an error
  * cases that shows logging of errors
* A tag has been created and released
* (nice-to-have) Usage of async and notes about the good and bad, lessons learned

#### Benefits

* Provides a means for transitioning from legacy to `cnx-publishing` publications

### Implement parallel publication in `press`

#### Description

Modify the publication endpoint to invoke the logic for completezip to EPUB in parallel. Still in parallel and non-obstructive/blocking to the existing publication procedure, publish the EPUB to a `cnx-publishing` running in a parallel environment.

(Optionally, experiment with making this async.)

#### Exit Criteria

* Ensures the parallel processing of the conversion anf publication to `cnx-publishing` does not affect the existing publication process
* Ensures that if the configured url for the `cnx-publishing` instance cannot be reached, the publication is not interrupted
* The tests should cover:
  * (should not cover) publication of the content
  * persistence of the EPUB artifact to the filesystem
  * cases that show useful debug information in the response during an error
  * cases that shows logging of errors
* A tag has been created and released
* (nice-to-have) Usage of async and notes about the good and bad, lessons learned

#### Benefits

### Deploy a testing environment to compare the production publications of `press`'s parallel publications

#### Description

Deploy a second copy of `cnx-publishing` for `dev` and `qa` environments. This will require a copy of the database and the `cnx-publishing` and `cnx-archive` codebases. `cnx-archive` is being added a means of retrieving the published results for comparison with what is coming out of the main `cnx-archive`.

#### Exit Criteria

* `cnx-publishing` & `cnx-archive` have been deployed to dev and qa
* A copy of the database has been setup

#### Benefits

* Provides an isolated environment for casually testing the results of the future intended process
* Gives us a way to compare the results of the two forms of publication using the exact same input

### Adjust the `press` publication endpoint to proxy EPUB publications to `cnx-publishing`

Modify the publication API endpoint for receiving a completezip payload, to allow for receiving an EPUB payload. Continue as usual if the contents are a completezip. If the contents are an EPUB, proxy the request to the main `cnx-publishing` instance.

#### Exit Criteria

* Ensures the publication route accepts and proxies an EPUB payload to the main `cnx-publishing` instance
* The tests should cover:
  * (should not cover) publication of the content
  * proxying of the request to a `cnx-publishing` endpoint (mocked)
  * cases that shows logging of errors, such as connectivity issues
* A tag has been created and released

#### Benefits

* Provides a means for transitioning from `press` to `cnx-publishing` publications

### Adjust `berg`'s implemention of `publish` to allow for publication via EPUB

#### Description

Modify `berg publish` to allow for publishing of EPUB contents

#### Exit Criteria

* `berg publish` works the same as it did with a completezip, but uses an EPUB file structure instead
* The tests should cover:
  * sends an EPUB to the `press` endpoint
  * on error, let's the user know to contact the site adminstrator
  * on success, returns the URL of the published content
* A tag has been created and released

#### Benefits

* Provides the same workflow, but uses a different format

- - -
Deliverable(s) reached: `press` now does Zope-like publications and tries converstion based publications in parallel to a testing environment & `berg publish` now allows for EPUB publication directly to `cnx-publishing`
- - -

### Analyze the comparison of Zope-like publications and conversion publications

#### Description

Analyze the results of our A (`press`) and hidden B (`cnx-publishing`) publication activities. Answer the following questions and create followup tasks where needed. What are the differences between the two forms of publication? Are the backwards compatible conversions (html->cnxml) correctly working? (Or maybe by this point, it no longer matters?)

#### Exit Criteria

* Differences have been captured in the form of issues (note, nothing is being done with this captured data at this point; it is only being recorded. Developers will later analyze the contents to make judgments)
* Future tasks have been added to the product backlog (not the current sprint)
* Developers have judged the newly created tasks and estimated effort necessary for completion
* Stakeholders have been informed of the updated timetable

### Implement an html validator within `cnx-epub`

#### Description

Implement logic to validate the cnx html content.

Additionally, validate the html contents of the table of contents document, which represent Binders and TranslucentBinders.

(Optionally, find a library that will do EPUB validation for EPUB specific files.)

#### Exit Criteria

* `cnx-epub` provides logic/functions for validating html content
* The tests should cover:
  * validation of html content within Document objects
  * validation of the resulting html in a Binder object
  * cases that show validation error reporting
* A tag has been created and released
* (nice-to-have) Validation of the entire EPUB file structure

### Collect feedback on `cnx-epub`'s EPUB format as a publication format

#### Description

Doubtless, as the Content Managers start to work with html content, they will use the EPUB format. Collect and record individual feedback about the usage/interactions the Content Managers are having with `cnx-epub`'s  EPUB file structure. Analyze the feedback for themes and shared painpoints.

Address any bugs by creating issues in the sprint's managment software of choice. Revise the product timetables based on the amount of revision, design changes, and issues added to the product backlog. Inform the stakeholders of the new timetable.

#### Exit Criteria

* Feedback has been recorded (captured in writing) in the form of issues (note, nothing is being done with this feedback; at this point no judgment is being made about the feedback, just that it exists; later developers will make judgments)
* Future tasks have been added to the product backlog (not the current sprint)
* Developers have judged the newly created tasks and estimated effort necessary for completion
* Stakeholders have been informed of the updated timetable

#### Benefits

* Gives the developers feedback in the form that doesn't interupt the current sprinting process
