CC = Concept Coach

## Tutor Ingests Book and Exercise Tag Map

## Tutor will have Special CC-Specific Courses

## Tutor Generates and Stores Per-Period CC Codes

`OX Tutor` will need to
generate and store
a per-`Period` `CC` `registration codes`
for each `CC-Specific Course`.

These codes will need to be made available
to third parties
for distribution to teachers and students.

## Tutor CC Plugin

## Anonymous User Visits CC Page URL

If an anonymous (not logged in) user
visits a `Cnx` `Page` with a `CC plugin`,
the `CC plugin` will display a login screen.

## Logged in User Visits CC Page URL

If a logged in `User`
visits a `Cnx` `Page` with a `CC plugin`,
the `CC plugin` display will depend
on whether or not `OX Tutor` can associate the combination
of `User` and `Book:Page` URL
with a `Student` in a `CC-Specific Course`.

### `User`/`Book:Page` Combo Identifies a `Student`

### `User`/`Book:Page` Combo Does NOT Identify a `Student`

If the `User`/`Book:Page` combination
does NOT identify a `Student`
in a `CC-Specific Course`,
the `CC plugin` will display
a place to enter a `registration code`.

Upon receipt of the
`User`/`Book:Page`/`registation code` triple,
`OX Tutor` will create a new `Student`
in the appropriate `Period`
of the `CC-Specific Course`
associated with the `registration code`.

`OX Tutor` will also create
a `CC` `Task` for the `Book:Page`
for the current `Student`.
This new `Task` will be displayed
in the `CC plugin`.
