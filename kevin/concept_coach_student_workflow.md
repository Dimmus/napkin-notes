The first time a `User` reaches `CC` on a given `Page`,
there will be a place to enter
the `CC-Specific Course` `registration code`.
(If the `User` has is not alreadly logged into `OX Tutor`,
a login prompt will be displayed instead.
Once logged in, however, the `registration code`
screen will be shown.)

The combination of
the `registration code` and `Cnx` URL
(both passed via the `Tutor javascript plugin`)
will allow `OX Tutor`
to auto-register the `User`
as a `Student`
in the `CC-Specific Course`.

Once the `Student` association has been made,
`OX Tutor` can issue
the `Student's` `CC` assignments
for each `Page` in the curent `Book`.
