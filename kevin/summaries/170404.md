I'm still working on the CLUE calculations.

## eCommerce

I wrote up a 
[list of questions/concerns](https://github.com/openstax/napkin-notes/blob/master/kevin/170330_eCommerceAndTutor.md)

of extracting a common BL Scheduler
that can be shared by all algorithms.
This should make like a lot easier
in the long run.
