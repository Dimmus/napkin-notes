## SGD-based SPARFA

I reviewed a chunk of the theory behind stochastic gradient decent (SGD) 
and how it can be applied to the SPARFA matrix factorization problem.

Some interesting resources are:

Two big questions still linger:
(1) What is the best way to sample our response data?
(2) Because each SPARFA inner interation will require a data query, will db access times dominate?
