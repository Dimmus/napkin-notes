## What appears at the bottom of a `Concept Coach` page?

Two groups of exercises: `core` and (optionally) `spaced practice`.

The number of `core` exercises
will be chosen by Tutor(?).

## What goes into the `core` exercise group?

Exercises covering content on the current `page`,
chosen by Tutor,
randomly(?) from the `CC exercise pool`
associated with the current `page`.

## What if we run out of `core` exercises?

Tutor will not repeat exercises
within the same `event`,
so the number of issued exercises
will be decreaed to match
the number of available exercises.

## What goes into the `spaced practice` exercise group?

If the student's `event` history,
combined with the `k-ago-map`,
indicate that `spaced practice` exercises
should be issued,
then Tutor will fill
the `k-ago-map`-specified exercise slots
using exercises
from the `k-ago-map`-specificied `event`'s
`CC exercise pool`.

## What is an event?

An `event` is a record of a single CNX `page` being read by a student.

## When does an `event` get added to the student's `event history`?

The current `page`
gets added to the student's `event history`
upon completion of the any (the first?) exercise
at the bottom of the `page`.
(CHECK based on mockup...)

## What if there are no exercises associated with a given `page`?

Then the`page` will never be added as an `event` 
to the student's `event history`,
and will never have exercises at the bottom
_even if_ 
spaced practice exercises
from past `pages`
are waiting.

## What about `pages` which are assigned together?

Each `page` is its own `event`, independent of the others.

## Can a `page` be to a student's `event history` more than once?

No.

## Will `Concept Coach` have personalized exercises?

No.
