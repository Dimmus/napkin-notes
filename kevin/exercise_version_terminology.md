# Exercise Versioning Terminology

The URL for an exercise from OpenStax Exercises ends in versioning information of the following form:
* `../A[@B]`

where:
* `A` is the `exercise ID`
* `B` is the `exercise version` (optional)

The full `exercise versioned id` is `A@B` 

in script that imports exercises into Exercises:
* `k12phys-ch01-ex001` = `exercise tag id`
