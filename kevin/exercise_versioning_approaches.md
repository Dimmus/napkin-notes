## Overview

## Exercises
* creates new exercise version with every edit
  * value after the `@` symbol changes
  * `answer_id`s change
* currently, no assurance that different versions of the same exercse are "equivalent"
  * what "equivalent" means could differ by consumer
  * or worse, "equivalent" could be conditional
* currently, no assurance that different exercises (much less versions) are NOT "equivalent"

## Exchange

* records de-identified students' answers to exercises (and the answer correctness)
  * currently only the exercise `url` and `answer_id` are recorded
    * this is NOT enough to (in the long-run) determine exactly HOW an exercise was presented
* must preseve research-grade information

## Tutor

* task content must be stable and reproducable
* potential need for auditing / dispute resolution
* indirectly (directly?) used for research
