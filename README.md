This repo contains electronic napkin notes. 

1. Un-Watch this repo so you don't get spammed
2. If you're editing a file in your directory no one depends on, don't bother with a Pull Request
3. If you're suggesting edits to someone else's file, please send a Pull Request and `@mention` them in it

That way, hopefully no one will actually have to watch the repo (and get bombarded with emails).
