This repo contains electronic napkin notes.

If you're editing a file in your directory, don't bother with a Pull Request.

If you're suggesting edits to someone else's file, please send a Pull Request and `@mention` them in it.

That way, hopefully no one will actually have to watch the repo (and get bombarded with emails).
