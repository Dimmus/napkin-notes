# Excercise Choice Blocks

1. If a group of exercises has the `ost-exercise-choice` tag, then create a problem that has the option for "try another" and
   "refresh my memory".
   - If there are more than one problem in the group, pick a random problem from within the block for each student so that we 
     get a distribution of problems.
2. Create the option of "try-another" "refresh-my-memory" "move-on" for when student gets the problem wrong

# Try Another

1. pick a matching problem that has the same problem type, for now `practice-problem`, and has the same LO
  - may come from the same group of problems from within the book content, or from tutor-only problems pulled in from exercises
  - distribute potential problems among students in the class
  - FUTURE: pick a recommended problem for this student

# Refresh my memory
