Some suggestions for trying this out:

- It's better to let too many people know than not enough
- Default to discussing in channels unless it really is just a discussion with 1 other person
- If having a bot in your channel is annoying, make a separate channel for them
- Add a Reaction to a chat [:thumbsup::5 :thumbsdown::2 ] instead of just typing "ok", "yeah", "no way" (or use it for voting like [:hamburger::2 :pizza::1 :ramen::3 :fried_shrimp::2 ])
- use `/remind` to remind folks about stuff (like to fill out the retrospective notes, or that a sprint will end)


# `#general`

- Posts should be very infrequent: ie "Official" Announcements
- Notify: It is expected everyone ​*must*​ read this. (like an upcoming holiday)

# Project Channels

1. Post here 1st and then move to a smaller group (w/ a link to the channel)
1. These should be low-chatter, and folks should monitor throughout the day (no bots in here)

- `#cnx`
- `#tutor`
- `#textbook`
- `#webredesign`
- `#cte`
- `#devops`
- `#marcom`

## SubProjects

- These are where most of the chatter/discussion occurs
- Notify: "only when `@mentioned`" is ok
- Feel free to `@mention` someone not in the channel; they can then leave
- Should contain at least 3 people

- `#tutor-devs`
- `#tutor-cpr`
- `#webredesign-devs`
- `#bronies-and-unicorns`
...

# Ad-hoc Channels

Great! Make'em, just please archive it when you're done (you can always un-archive'em).


# Other Channels

- `#meta`: Questions/Tips/Gripes about Slack
- `#watercooler`: non-work or naval-gazing
- `#deployments`: When code is deployed to servers
