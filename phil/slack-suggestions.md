Some suggestions for trying this out:

- It's better to let too many people know than not enough
- Default to discussing in channels unless it really is just a discussion with 1 other person
- If having a bot in your channel is annoying, make a separate channel for them (ie `#tutor-alerts`)
- Add a Reaction to a chat [:thumbsup::5 :thumbsdown::2 ] instead of just typing "ok", "yeah", "no way" (or use it for voting like [:hamburger::2 :pizza::1 :ramen::3 :fried_shrimp::2 ])
- use `/remind` to remind folks about stuff (like to fill out the retrospective notes, or that a sprint will end)


# `#general`

- Posts should be very infrequent: ie "Official" Announcements
- **Notify:** It is expected everyone **must** read this. (like an upcoming holiday)

# Project Channels

- Post here 1st and then move to a smaller group (w/ a link to the channel)
- These should be low-chatter, and folks should monitor throughout the day (no bots in here)
- **Notify:** It is expected everyone **may** read this.

Channels (these will match GitHub team names so you can `@mention` them in GitHub too):

- `#cnx`
- `#tutor`
- `#textbook`
- `#webredesign`
- `#cte`
- `#ux`
- `#test-support`
- `#devops`
- `#marcom`

## SubProjects

- These are where most of the chatter/discussion occurs
- **Notify:** "only when `@mentioned`" is :ok:
- Feel free to `@mention` someone not in the channel; they can then leave
- Should contain at least 3 people

Examples:

- `#tutor-devs`
- `#tutor-cpr`
- `#webredesign-devs`
- `#bronies-and-unicorns`
- `#all-devs`
...


# Ad-hoc Channels

Great! Make'em, just please archive it when you're done (you can always un-archive'em).


# Other Channels

- `#meta`: Questions/Tips/Gripes about Slack or Openstax
- `#watercooler`: non-work or naval-gazing
- `#deployments`: When code is deployed to servers
- `#bot-test`: For testing bot output
- `#lunch_puzzle`: The daily puzzle of lunch
