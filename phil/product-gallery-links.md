Story / Mockups

* Readings 

    * As a student, I want to know relative size and relative progress as I'm completing a reading assignment and I want access to the entire reading and milestones.** **I also want a good mobile experience.** **[Mockup](http://jdy18n.axshare.com/#reading_1&p=reading_1) 

* Value proposition: 2-step questions

    * As a student, if I need help on a question, I want a link back into the content to find help *(bottom of each question)*, and I want to understand why I am being asked to type a free response *(submit free response and click on "i")* and why I sometimes see review questions *(click on "reading 4" to see this one)*.  [Mockup](http://jdy18n.axshare.com/#p=reading_2) 

* LMS and College Workflow

    *  As faculty, I want to create links to assigned readings and homework in my LMS (*Click HW 4*) [ ](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/115729169)[Mockup](http://jdy18n.axshare.com/#p=teacher_dashboard)

* Student Dashboard

    * As a college student, I need more schedule flexibility and to **see ALL my work**, rather than having a heavy emphasis on "This Week".  [January](http://jdy18n.axshare.com/#p=student_dashboard_-_january)    [March](http://jdy18n.axshare.com/#p=student_dashboard_-_march)

* Question library

    * As faculty, I want to review all assessments that my students might see, and I want to exclude questions that I do not think are relevant for my class, or where I have found errors. (*It isn't shown, but faculty get here from the name menu*) [Concept Coach Mockup](http://jdy18n.axshare.com/#p=cc_question_library&c=1) (Tutor very similar)
