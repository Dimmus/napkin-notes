`GET /user/tasks` (all classes) or `GET /classes/012/tasks`:

```coffee-script
{
  total_count: 1
  items: [
    {                           # The task
      url: 'https://localhost/api/tasks/123'  # This is my personal pref
                                              # for update operations
                                              # but can be omitted for now ; )
      id: 123
      type: 'homework'
      name: 'First Homework'
      coworkers: []
      opens_at:
      due_at:
      homework_field_1:
      homework_field_2:
      exercises: []             # These can probably be omitted from the search results
    }
  ]
}
```

# Student Perspective

Then, `PATCH /api/tasks/123` would allow for updating `{homework_field1:, homework_field_2:}` but not other fields

and `PUT /api/tasks/123/coworkers/234` would allow adding/removing coworkers




# Teacher Perspective

- they could change the due date by doing a `PATCH /api/tasks/123` and sending `{due_at: }`

They edit a task plan by doing a `PATCH /plans/234` with `{name: , opens_at: , due_at: , homework_field_1: }`
and add exercises by:
- doing a `PUT /plans/234/exercises` with `[456, 567, 678]` if exercises are ordered or
- doing a `PUT /plans/234/exercises/678` if exercises are unordered
