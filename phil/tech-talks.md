# Tech Talks

## Guidelines:

- 15 minutes to present

When proposing one, include the following next to your item

1. your GitHub username
1. which Friday you want to present
1. link to slides or list-o-links with descriptions and link-to-recording-afterwards so someone else can listen in later.

    - dak's sprint demo but more techy and less-interrupty
- When to use, when to skip? coverage, integration, unit tests
    - when should something be a unit test, integration test, dev performance test
    - when is coverage useful and how should it be collected (ie QA would like it to be collected during the manual tests)
- SASS vs LESS (organizing code for styling books)
