Tutor Behavior and Behavior Invariants

**Multiple features**

No question will be asked twice in a single assignment, where an assignment is a reading, a homework, a practice widget set, or a ConceptCoach quiz. 

	Needs verification

**Practice Widget**

Practice widget does not repeat questions in any way. If you have seen the question in the reading, in a hw, or if you have previously practiced this question, you will never see that question again.

**Performance Forecast**

In the performance forecast, what does X students worked Y problems mean?

1. It means X students have provided Y **responses** on this topic. E.g., if 10 students each answer the same one question, it will say "10 students have worked 10 questions." In my opinion, the current verbiage is misleading.
