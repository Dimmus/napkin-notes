# Low-hanging ideas

- Organize Component files into subdirs
- Fix bugs listed in `./test-integration/` files (grep for "BUG" or "TODO")

# Prep for Concept Coach

- Refactor exercise rendering out to be used as a widget in cnx (maybe separate repo?)

# Non-trivial ideas

- Chunk JS files (from webpack) into teacher JS and student JS.
- Remove phantomjs from some unit tests (they are taking 5.5min)
- Allow the media popover to be on any `<ArbitraryHtmlAndMath>` ? Just provide it a fn (Promise?) to look up the context HTML ?

# Possible time-sinks

- upgrade react-router
- Move away from mixins
- Reduce re-render calls
