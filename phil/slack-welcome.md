# Welcome!

Here are some notes by stax folks using Slack. Click the pencil icon (just up and right of here) and submit a Pull Request to amend this list!

Channels:

- `#watercooler` non-official chatter, or _cool_ things you want to chat about
- `#deployments` lets you know when deployments start/finish and what code is being deployed
- `#cpr` and `#tutor-fe` are pretty active channels (you can preview without joining)

# Tips

- Change your notification preferences for different channels. That way you can peruse `#deployments` or `#watercooler` without being notified whenever someone posts.
- (*devs*) Snippets allow you to send a block of syntax-highlighted code
- Type `/remind` to set up reminders
- Type `/hangout` to create a hangout or pin the hangout URL for recurring meetings (Click the "Start Hangout" link)
- Pin a message for useful links and things for folks in a channel
- Add your GitHub username to the list of Highlight Words (in Preferences) to get notified when someone mentions you in GitHub
- Edit a message by pressing the <kbd>...</kbd> button next to the message
- Tired of sending a message to multiple people? You can create a group and they'll all be notified


# Gripes

- No ad-hoc group chats
- Difficult to do Audio/Screensharing with a channel (Screenhero does do audio/video but you have to select people each time)
