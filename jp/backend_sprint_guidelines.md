## Backend Sprint Guidelines

The following guidelines apply to all backend development in sprints:

1. At the start of a sprint, please estimate the points for each of your cards.
1. For those of you with cards dealing with Tutor producing an API, by one week into the sprint I'd like to have the endpoint active on master with at least fake data and a rake script that can be run to generate that data.
2. Any decent sized feature PR that will have a FE component must be accompanied by a rake task that sets up data appropriately.
3. Know who is working on the FE side of your tasks, and connect with them early on in the sprint.
4. Give Kevin as hard a time as possible, on whatever you feel like.  When he objects, blam it on Dante.
5. Go through your cards (and those of other devs on this list) and think about the relative priorities, what might need to be done first to unblock someone else.  I'll do this too but I need your help.
6. When you run across an issue or something that isn't right (but that you can't fix immediately), write it down on the next sprint retrospective document.  If there isn't one yet, create one or ask me to create one.

## Working with cards in Pivotal

1. When you start working on a card, make sure to mark it as started.
2. When you make a non-WIP PR, put the PR link in the activity comments and click Finish then Deliver ("finishing" a card doesn't mean anything to us)
3. When someone does the review, the tests pass, and it is merged, the Accept button can be clicked.

Note this is different from the frontend process, because their "Accept" click is tied to UX / Greg doing manual testing.
